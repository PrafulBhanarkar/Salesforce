Code:

trigger AccountAddressTrigger on Account (before insert, before update) {
      for (account a : trigger.new){
        if (a.Match_Billing_Address__c == true){
            a.ShippingPostalCode = a.BillingPostalCode;
        }
    }
}


Note: 
•	Please check you any trigger you have on Account object which is creating opportunity ? If yes then please deactivate the trigger and try again.
•	Please try to de-activate all other triggers and validation rules on Account object and try again.


Error: 
Challenge not yet complete in My Trailhead Playground 1
We updated an account that had 'Match_Billing_Address__c' set to false. We expected the Apex trigger not to fire, but it did.
Make sure the Apex trigger fires only if 'Match_Billing_Address__c' is true.

System.DmlException: Insert failed. First exception on row 0; first error: CANNOT_INSERT_UPDATE_ACTIVATE_ENTITY, 
AddRelatedRecord: execution of AfterInsert caused by: System.DmlException: Insert failed. First exception on row 0; 
first error: REQUIRED_FIELD_MISSING, Required fields are missing: [Discount_percent__c]: [Discount_percent__c]

Solution: 
It look like you created any trigger "AddRelatedRecord" which is creating some record and in that record Discount_percent__c field required field
Please deactivate that trigger or Edit "Discount_percent__c" field and remove required checkbox. (available in Opportunity)
