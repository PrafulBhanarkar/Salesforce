Install an AppExchange dashboard package and make updates to one of the dashboards
Youâ€™ve been asked to create a new Lead trending dashboard. Rather than creating the dashboard from scratch, 
install a CRM adoption dashboard package from AppExchange in your Trailhead Playground and update one of the dashboard components as specified below. 
(Note: While it's a best practice to clone a dashboard before you modify it, for this example, you can go ahead and edit the dashboard directly.)

      If you're having trouble installing this app, check out Install a Package or App to Complete a Trailhead Challenge on Trailhead Help.
      In your Trailhead Playground, install the Sales Adoption Dashboards from AppExchange
      Package ID: 04t4x000000pALsAAM
      Refresh the 3 - Sales & Marketing Adoption dashboard in the Salesforce Adoption Dashboards folder at least once
      In the 3 - Sales & Marketing Adoption dashboard, edit the New LEAD Trend by Source component and uncheck the Use chart as defined in source report option
      Change the dashboard component for New LEAD Trend by Source to a pie chart and set the wedges to Lead Source
      Save your changes
