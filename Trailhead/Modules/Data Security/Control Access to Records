Setup --> object manager --> create --> custom object -->
Create a custom object:
      Label: Project
      Plural Label: Projects
      Object Name: Project
      Record Name: Project Name
      Record Name Data Type: Text
      Search Status : Allow Search --> save

Configure organization-wide default sharing settings for the Project object so that Project records are visible only to the record owner.
Also configure the sharing settings so that Project records are visible to users above them in the role hierarchy. (We won't check for this.)

Setup --> sharing setting --> Edit --> Project --> Default Internal Access : Private, Default External Access : Private --> Save
